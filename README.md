## Core Capabilities

- **Activity Tracking**: Manage tasks with status, priorities, due dates, and categories
- **Journaling**: Record thoughts, progress, and reflections
- **Smart Analysis**: Get insights about your task load, schedule, and wellbeing

- **Dependency Management**: Track relationships between tasks
- **Time Tracking**: Record time spent and improve estimations
- **Habit Support**: Build consistency in important routines
- **Visual Insights**: See patterns and progress over time

## Getting Started

When you first launch AMA v8.0, you'll be prompted with:

```
I have no data, what shall I do?
```

You can respond with one of these options:

1. **Load existing data**: Paste a previous snapshot (compatible with v7.0 and earlier)
2. **Start fresh**: Begin with a clean slate
3. **Run automated onboarding**: Answer a few key questions to set up quickly
4. **Request sample data**: See how the system works with demonstration data

## Basic Usage

### Managing Tasks

```
Add review presentation slides, due Thursday, high priority
Mark doctor appointment as done
What's due today?
Show me my high priority tasks
```

### Journaling

```
Journal: Feeling overwhelmed but made progress on the main project
Add note to website project: Need to check mobile compatibility
```

### Using Advanced Features

```
Mark budget review as sensitive
Take a snapshot of my current tasks
Remind me about the presentation tomorrow at 9am
Make the launch dependent on finishing the testing
I spent 45 minutes on the database work
Track my daily writing practice
Show me a timeline of the project
```

## New Features in v8.0

### Guided Enrichment

AMA v8.0 now proactively helps identify:
- Gaps in your activity tracking
- Missing updates that might be helpful
- Journal opportunities for reflection
- Important context that could improve your task management

Simply ask:
```
Where are the gaps in my activity tracking?
What am I missing in my current setup?
Help me improve my task management
```

### Enhanced Onboarding

The new automated onboarding asks targeted questions to get you started quickly:
```
Start automated onboarding with 5 minute setup
```

### Smart Analysis On Request

Get insights when you need them:
```
Analyze my current task load
Check for scheduling conflicts
How is my current workload affecting my wellbeing?
```

## Data Management

### Saving Your Data

To save your current state for future sessions:
```
Save my data for next time
Take a snapshot
```

This will generate a data snapshot you can copy and save.

### Loading Data

When starting fresh, simply paste your previously saved snapshot when prompted.

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Brief daily check-ins help maintain accuracy
2. **Task Specificity**: More detailed task descriptions lead to better analysis
3. **Context Notes**: Adding context to tasks improves suggestions
4. **Reflection**: Periodic journaling enhances wellbeing tracking
5. **Time Tracking**: Recording actual time spent improves future estimates

## Known Limitations and Workarounds

### Visualization
- **Limitation**: Visualizations are text-based rather than graphical
- **Workaround**: Request data in tabular format or use descriptive comparisons

### Reminders
- **Limitation**: Recurring reminders may need periodic reconfirmation
- **Workaround**: Include important recurring reminders in your regular snapshots

### Time Zones
- **Limitation**: Time zone management requires explicit specification
- **Workaround**: Always specify time zone when setting time-sensitive reminders

## Feature Comparison with v7.0

For users upgrading from v7.0, here are the key differences:

- **Removed**: System design and documentation management
- **Changed**: Impact analysis now on-request rather than automatic
- **Changed**: Schedule adjustments suggested rather than automatic
- **Added**: Guided enrichment for identifying gaps
- **Enhanced**: More flexible and guided initial setup
- **Improved**: More intuitive organization and natural language
